# NumberShapes

Application that checks if a number is square, triangular or both.

The application is created on Android Oreo 8.1 (API 27). I used an editText in which only numbers can be entered, a label that contains a suggestive message and a button to check. I used two classes:
  - MainActivity where we realized the functionality of the check button
  - Number where we created the functions that check if the number is square or triangular.
